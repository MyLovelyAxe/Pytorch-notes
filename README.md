## Pytorch-notes

This collection of notes is arrangement of my previous notes of self-learning of Pytorch, which is from tutotial Videos and materials of Liangqu Long from Bilibili. In the notes I have divided the subjects according to my own learning path. All PDFs are from tutorial, but all .ipynb and almost all .py are my own personal learning notes.

The subjects include:

#### 1 Software and Introduction

  1. Pytorch Introduction
  
  2. Pytorch installation
  
#### 2 Examples of Deep Learning

  1. Regression
  
  2. Handwriting Digit Detection
  
#### 3 Basic Operations in Pytorch

  1. Data Type
  
  2. Tensor Building
  
  3. Slicing and Indexing
  
  4. Concatenation and Division
  
  5. Math Operation
  
  6. Dimension Changing
  
  7. Broadcast
  
  8. Statistics
  
  9. Other Advanced Operation
  
#### 4 Gradients and Perceptrons

  2. Backpropagation
  
  3. Multi-Perceptron
