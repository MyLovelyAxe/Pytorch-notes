## Pytorch-notes

This collection of notes is arrangement of my previous notes of self-learning of Pytorch, which is from tutotial Videos and materials of Liangqu Long from Bilibili. In the notes I have divided the subjects according to my own learning path. All PDFs are from tutorial, but all .ipynb and almost all .py are my own personal learning notes.

The subjects include:

3 Basic Operations in Pytorch
  01 Data Type
  02 Tensor Building
  03 Slicing and Indexing
  04 Concatenation and Division
  05 Math Operation
  06 Dimension Changing
